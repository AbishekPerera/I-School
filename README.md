# I-School

MAD Group Project

# It’s time to keep a full stop to your busy scheduled academic life! 
# Manage your daily academic work with the “iSchool” school management app.

<p> 
For the 2nd year 2nd semester “Mobile Application Development” module project, we designed the “iSchool” mobile app to manage academic related activities easily and with great security. 
<br>

✅ Students can create accounts with their emails and with added email verifications to improve security.

✅ Track your study time through Rocket time table,

✅ Adding to-do list tasks,

✅ Creating perfect notes,

✅ Scanning QR codes and BarCodes,

✅ Store your newly found words in your own word dictionary

are the main tasks that the students can perform through this app. 

This also includes scientific calculators to do mathematical operations easily for your studies. 

With those great features, this app will be one of the best apps for students to manage their busy academic life.
